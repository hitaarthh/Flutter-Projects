# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

In this Project I have dived deep into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages and building repeated widgets using dynamic dart functions. This is the first version of my Xylophone APP, created using dart functionality, which reduces the redudancy of code, we can even build this App without using making widget functions(the lengthy way), that will be uploaded after this Project.

## What I have Made:

I have made a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are. Feel free to download this Project and enjoy this Application on your Android/iOS devices.
