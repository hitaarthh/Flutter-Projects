## ðŸ¤”--> How is it different and efficient from traditional ways of creating Applications.
- Flutter is a cross-platform framework which helps to launch apps on iOS, Android and WebApps from a single codebase, so the developer doesn't need to maintain different codebases for all the types of platforms.
- Flutter has a _"hot reload"_ feature which helps us to quickly view the changes we made in our codebase, without actually re-starting the application everytime.
- Flutter was designed by the Google Web Development team, hence it is very similar to that of Web Development and easy to use.
- Its an open-source project, hence it has a very large community support.
